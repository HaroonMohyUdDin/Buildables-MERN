                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Luna Photography! I'm Luna, a passionate photographer with over 10 years of experience capturing life's most precious moments. My journey began with a simple love for the way light dances across landscapes and the genuine emotions that unfold during special occasions.</p>
                
                <p>Specializing in landscape, wedding, and street photography, I believe that every photograph should tell a story. Whether it's the serene beauty of a mountain sunrise, the joy of a couple's first dance, or the raw energy of urban life, I strive to create images that evoke emotion and preserve memories for generations to come.</p>
                
                <p>My approach combines technical expertise with artistic vision, ensuring that each photograph is not just a picture, but a work of art that speaks to the heart. I'm dedicated to working closely with my clients to understand their vision and bring it to life through my lens.</p>
